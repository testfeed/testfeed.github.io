<p>I'll be joining <a title="Tony Bruce blog" href="http://dancedwiththetester.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tony Bruce</a> to present at the Agile Testing &amp; BDD Exchange at Skills Matter in London, on 22nd of November 2013. We'll be covering the subject "What do testers do?". Topics will include: what makes a tester tick, what sort of skills are useful to a tester and more than anything else how a tester brings value to a project, to the organisation and the client.<br />
