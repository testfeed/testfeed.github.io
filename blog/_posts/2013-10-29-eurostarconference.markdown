<p>Shortly Eurostar Conference will be under way from 4th of November to 7th of November in Gothenburg, Sweden. If you have never attended the conference, it's a great way to meet a lot of people that make up the European testing community. It's also one of the best ways to learn about software testing and what it means to go beyond the day to day job. The conference will be packed with people passionate about their trade eager to see what's new in the wild and get a different perspective on existing practices.<br />
This year the conference will take a new turn in the form of cutting down the speaker's time to 30 minutes thus allowing for more audience interaction which can only be beneficial for both sides.</p>
<p>I'll be there presenting on the topic ofÂ Questioning Acceptance Tests on Tuesday 5th of November from 16:00 (UTC +1). It will be a mixture of technologies we're using at LMAX Exchange to increase our testing coverage. You'll be hearing a lot about <a title="No....not that Spock....this Spock - https://code.google.com/p/spock/" href="http://www.startrek.com/database_article/spock">Spock</a>, <a title="QuickCheck on WIkipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck" target="_blank">QuickCheck</a> and <a title="Property based testing post" href="http://blog.jessitron.com/2013/04/property-based-testing-what-is-it.html" target="_blank">property based testing</a>.
