<p>LMAX Exchange is looking for a new senior tester who enjoys technical challenges. If you're interested here are some of the things we're looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are doing exploratory testing with all sorts of tools,</li>
<li>you have been using Webdriver for quite some time now but you don't shy away from an API level test,</li>
<li>you understand web technologies and you know why Chrome/Firefox are better browsers than IE at the moment,</li>
<li>you understand how Javascript and HTML tie together,</li>
<li>you have dabbled into Linux and liked it for your back-end testing needs,</li>
<li>you like coding your own tools to uncover different emergent behaviours in the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you join LMAX Exchange, you'll get to play with a very mature custom testing framework (think API clients and Webdriver) and interact with some of the best Java developers out there. Also you'll be part of a proper agile team where the business actually gets it.</p>
